Disqus has dropped support for their recent comments widget.  This plugin ceates a configurable widget that will display your latest Disqus comments.

== Description ==

The Disqus Recent Comments Widget plugin will create a configurable widget that will allow you to display comments in any widgetized area of your theme like sidebars and footers.

You can customize the comment length and date format, filter users and choose from three different markup templates, among other things.  The plugin has full support for custom markup defined with register_sidebars() and should integrate smoothly with most themes in the wp.org repository.

We try to be very proactive and responsive with support.  So, if you have any issues, please post in the support forums and we'll do our best to resolve your issue promptly.

You can follow development here: https://github.com/andrewbartel/Disqus_Recent_Comments

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the ZIP file and drop the 'disqus-recent-comments' folder into your 'wp-content/plugins/' folder.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Enter your short name and api key in the settings page.
4. If you're having trouble configuring the settings, please see http://deusmachine.com/disqus-instructions.php

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Hey what happened to the caching and custom layouts in this release? =

Sorry, it was a really busy November and I wanted to push out a release that had bug fixes and a new layout at least.  I will get those added asap.

= Why did the comments stop appearing? =

Disqus caps the number of requests you can make to their api at 1000 an hour for free accounts. Comments will start appearing again next hour.

= I blocked a user, but their comments are still appearing =

Make sure you entered the exact author name. The plugin does its best to account for spaces, capitalization, etc but it can't read your mind. If all else fails, copy/paste their name into the filtered users field.

= I can't figure out this API key stuff, help? =

Please see this guide: http://deusmachine.com/disqus-instructions.php
