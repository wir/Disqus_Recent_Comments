== Installation ==


1. Unzip the ZIP file and drop the 'disqus-recent-comments' folder into your 'wp-content/plugins/' folder.

3. Enter your short name and api key in the settings page.

4. If you're having trouble configuring the settings, please see http://deusmachine.com/disqus-instructions.php



== Frequently Asked Questions ==



= Why did the comments stop appearing? =


Disqus caps the number of requests you can make to their api at 1000 an hour for free accounts.  Comments will start appearing again next hour.



= I blocked a user, but their comments are still appearing, what gives? =



Make sure you entered the exact author name.  The plugin does its best to account for spaces, capitalization, etc but it can't read your mind.  If all else fails, copy/paste their name into the filtered users field.



= I can't figure out this API key stuff, help? =
